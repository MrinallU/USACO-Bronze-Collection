# USACO-Bronze-Collection 2014-Present
A collection of USACO bronze solutions for the purpose to help anyone starting their programming journey. 
# Instructions
1. Please don't just copy and paste code, you will not learn anything, take a look at my thought proccess and try to make a slightly different solution
or improve on mine. 
2. Just search the file of the desired solution.
3. PR if you would like to add more solutions from pervious year and you can become a contributor as well!
# Disclaimers
1. Only three solutions only miss about 1 test case. The rest are all right. 
2. Please ignore the question revegetate.java because that one is open for people to try for themselves it is a harder question so anyone that gives me a solution different from the official one becomes a contributor!
